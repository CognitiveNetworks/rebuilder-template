# Feature Parity Matrix

> Complete list of every user-facing feature, integration, and workflow in the legacy application.
> Each feature gets a status. The rebuild is not complete until every **Must Rebuild** and **Rebuild Improved** feature passes acceptance testing.
>
> See `WINDSURF.md` > Feature Parity Tracking for requirements.

## Features

| Feature | Legacy Behavior | Status | Target Behavior | Acceptance Criteria | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | Must Rebuild | | | |
| | | Rebuild Improved | | | |
| | | Intentionally Dropped | | | |
| | | Deferred | | | |

### Status Definitions

- **Must Rebuild** — feature must exist in the target with equivalent behavior
- **Rebuild Improved** — feature will be rebuilt with specific improvements
- **Intentionally Dropped** — feature will not be rebuilt (requires documented justification below)
- **Deferred** — feature will be rebuilt in a later phase

## Intentionally Dropped — Justifications

| Feature | Justification |
